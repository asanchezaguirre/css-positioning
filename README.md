# CSS Positioning

## Instructions

Use what you've learned of CSS position properties to recreate the site components shown below.


## Setup

1. In your terminal:
  ```sh
  # (1) Navigate to `~/muktek/assignments` directory.
  cd ~/muktek/assignments

  # (2) Create the assignment directory and cd into it
  mkdir css-positioning
  cd css-positioning

  # (3) Download + unzip the project files from *inside* the css-positioning directory.
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muktek/assignment--css-positioning/master/assignment-files.zip > assignment-files.zip
  ```

2. Do the exercises. You will need to modify the relevant position properties in each `ex-*` folder's `style.css` file.

3. Make sure you include:
  ```css
  * { box-sizing: border-box }
  ```
